# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to tackle the critical issue of credit card fraud using AI-powered machine learning techniques. It demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and optionally deploy a real-time fraud detection system using Python and Google Colab.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud results in huge financial losses worldwide. Traditional static fraud detection systems often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving fraud tactics. This project proposes a machine learning approach to accurately detect fraudulent transactions in near real-time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions accurately.
- Minimize false positives and false negatives.
- Simulate real-time alerts or blocking for suspicious transactions.
- Visualize fraud trends and model decision insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Notebook:** Google Colab / Jupyter  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `shap`  
- **Optional Deployment:** `Flask` or `Streamlit`

## 📚 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) 
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection CSV file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1huCQ_f24PD2pu2XqTonD--B0bimKkPDH/view?usp=drivesdk) 
- **Nature:** Public, static dataset with anonymized features

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** - Download and prepare the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values, remove duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understand patterns using plots and correlation matrices.
4. **Feature Engineering** - Scaling, PCA (optional), and time-based features.
5. **Modeling** - Apply Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Isolation Forest.
6. **Evaluation** - Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC due to class imbalance.
7. **Visualization** - Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, SHAP plots for explainability.
8. **Deployment** (Optional) - Simple Flask/Streamlit app for real-time demo.

## 📈 Results
The project evaluates different models and provides interpretability tools (like SHAP) to understand model decisions. Evaluation is based on performance metrics relevant to fraud detection.
